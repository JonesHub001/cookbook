How Last Four Digits are Stored in Payment Submissions

Location of Implementation: src/components/ContactForm.tsx

Specific Code Logic:
1. In the onSubmit function, the last four digits are extracted using slice method:
   ```typescript
   const cardLastFour = data.cardNumber.slice(-4);
   ```

This approach ensures that:
- Only the last 4 digits are stored
- Full card number is never persisted
- The extraction happens right before database insertion

Security Considerations:
- Removes the full card number from storage
- Provides just enough information for potential reference
- Follows payment data protection best practices

Supabase Insertion Point:
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('payment_submissions')
  .insert({
    // ... other fields
    card_last_four: cardLastFour,
    // ... 
  });
```

Note: This method safely masks the complete card number while retaining a minimal identifier for potential future reference.
